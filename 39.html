    <h1>The Thirty-Nine Steps</h1>
    <p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <hr class="divider">
    The Thirty-Nine Steps is an adventure novel by the Scottish author John Buchan. It first appeared as a serial in
    Blackwood's Magazine, as by “H de V.”, in July, August and September 1915 before being published in book form in
    October that year by William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh. It is the first of the five novels featuring Richard
    Hannay, an all-action hero with a stiff upper lip and a miraculous knack for getting himself out of tricky
    situations.[1][2]

    The novel formed the basis for a number of successful adaptations, including several film versions and a
    long-running stage play.[1] In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's "best-loved
    novels."[3]<br>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <hr class="divider">
    John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps while he was ill in bed with a duodenal ulcer, an illness which remained
    with him all his life. Buchan's son, William, later wrote that the name of the book originated when the author's
    daughter was counting the stairs at St Cuby, a private nursing home on Cliff Promenade in Broadstairs, where Buchan
    was convalescing. "There was a wooden staircase leading down to the beach. My sister, who was about six, and who had
    just learnt to count properly, went down them and gleefully announced: there are 39 steps." There were actually 78,
    but he halved the number to make a better title. When the original steps were later replaced, one of them, complete
    with a brass plaque, was sent to Buchan.[4] They were replaced by concrete, and this set, now numbering 108, still
    runs from the garden to the beach.[5]

    The novel was his first "shocker", as he called it—a story combining personal and political dramas. It marked a
    turning point in Buchan's literary career and introduced his adventuring hero Richard Hannay. He described a
    "shocker" as an adventure where the events in the story are unlikely and the reader is only just able to believe
    that they really happened.[4]
    <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
    <hr class="divider">
    In May 1914, war looms in Europe. Richard Hannay returns home to London after living in Rhodesia. One night his
    neighbour, an American who claims to be in fear for his life, visits Hannay. The man appears to know of an anarchist
    plot to destabilise Europe, beginning with a plan to assassinate the Greek Premier, Constantine Karolides, during
    his forthcoming visit to London.<br>

    The man, named Franklin P. Scudder, is a freelance spy, and reveals that he has faked his own death. Scudder claims
    to be following a ring of German spies called the Black Stone who are trying to steal British plans for the outbreak
    of war. Hannay, convinced of his honesty, lets Scudder hide in his flat. Police discover the fake suicide and
    suspect nothing, but Hannay finds Scudder murdered in his flat a few days later nonetheless. Feeling now part of the
    plot, Hannay takes up Scudder's encoded notebook and escapes his apartment by disguising himself as the milkman one
    day.<br>

    Hannay takes a train leaving from London to Galloway, in south-west Scotland, believing it sufficiently remote to
    hide in until the fateful 15 June (a date noted by Scudder relevant to the anarchist's plot). Hannay lodges in a
    shepherd's cottage and reads in a newspaper that the police are looking for him in Scotland, suspecting him of
    Scudder's murder. Hannay boards a local train heading east, but jumps off between stations to confuse his trail. He
    eventually finds an inn where he stays the night. He tells the innkeeper a modified version of his story, and the
    man is persuaded to shelter him. While staying at the inn, Hannay cracks the cipher used in Scudder's codebook. The
    next day two men arrive at the inn looking for Hannay, but the innkeeper sends them away. When they return later,
    Hannay steals their car and escapes.<br>

    By this time, Hannay is being pursued by an aeroplane, and a policeman in a remote village tries to stop him as he
    drives through. He decides to stay off the main roads, but not knowing the area, nearly gets into a crash. To avoid
    it, he ditches the car, which falls off a cliff. The other driver, Harry Bullivant, a local landowner and
    prospective politician, takes pity on him after seeing his dirty clothes and takes him home to clean up. When he
    learns of Hannay's experiences in South Africa, he invites him to address an election meeting that afternoon.
    Hannay's speech impresses Harry (and is far better than Harry's own), and Hannay feels able to trust him with his
    story. Harry writes an introductory letter about Hannay to a relation in the Foreign Office to thank him for his
    speech and help him with the plot.
    <br>
    Hannay leaves Harry and tries to hide in the countryside, but is spotted from the aeroplane. Soon he spots a group
    of men on the ground searching for him. Miraculously, he meets a road mender out on the moor, and swaps places with
    him, sending the workman home. His disguise fools his pursuers, who pass him by. On the same road he encounters an
    acquaintance from London (whom he hates) named Marmaduke Jopley. He takes his clothes and drives his car several
    miles away before leaving Jopley.<br>

    Now back on foot, his pursuers find Hannay, and he runs off. He finds a cottage and enters, desperate for cover, and
    the occupant excitedly welcomes him. Unfortunately, the man turns out to be one of the enemy, and with his
    accomplices he locks Hannay into his storage room. Fortunately, the room in which Hannay is locked is full of
    bomb-making materials, which he uses to break out of the cottage. Without cover or means to escape cars or the
    plane, Hannay hides on top of a building until nightfall, then runs off.<br>

    Hannay returns to and retrieves his possessions from the helpful road mender and stays for a few days to recover
    from the explosion. He departs by train to meet Harry's relative at the Foreign Office, Sir Walter Bullivant. As
    they discuss Scudder's notes, Sir Walter receives a phone call to tell him that Karolides has indeed been
    assassinated. Sir Walter and his cohort return to London with Hannay, where they clear his name at Scotland Yard and
    release him, apparently free of involvement in the plot. Hannay feels agitated and unfulfilled; he runs into
    Marmaduke Jopley again and starts a fight. With the police after him again, he flees to Sir Walter's home, where he
    finds him in a meeting with several officials, including the First Sea Lord. While Hannay waits for the meeting to
    end, the First Sea Lord leaves. They briefly make eye contact and Hannay is certain the man is one of his pursuers
    in disguise. They call the real First Sea Lord's home, where a servant informs them he is asleep in bed.<br>

    Desperate to stop the imposter from escaping with their secrets, Hannay and the officials comb Scudder's codebook.
    They reason that the phrase "the thirty-nine steps," along with the date and tidal information (high tide at 10:17
    PM) must indicate the location of the escape point for the conspirators. With the help of a coast guardsman, they
    set off for a quiet middle-class location by the sea. They find an area with several sets of steps, one of them
    having 39, and an anchored yacht called "Ariadne". They approach the yacht posing as fishermen and discover the
    officer on board is German. Hannay watches three men in a villa who match the description of his pursuers, but their
    normal behaviour causes him to doubt their involvement.<br>

    Despite his doubts, he confronts the men. A subtle gesture assures him that they are his pursuers, and his men enter
    to arrest them. Although one escapes, bound for the boat, Hannay reveals they have already taken the boat, and all
    three men are arrested. The United Kingdom enters World War I three weeks later, her secrets intact, with Hannay
    commissioned captain.<br>
    <h3>Literary significance and criticism</h3>
    <hr class="divider">
    The Thirty-Nine Steps is one of the earliest examples of the '"man-on-the-run" thriller archetype subsequently
    adopted by film makers as a much-used plot device. In The Thirty-Nine Steps, Buchan holds up Richard Hannay as an
    example to his readers of an ordinary man who puts his country's interests before his own safety. The story was a
    great success with the men in the First World War trenches. One soldier wrote to Buchan, "The story is greatly
    appreciated in the midst of mud and rain and shells, and all that could make trench life depressing."
    <br>
    Hannay continued his adventures in four subsequent books. Two were set during the war, when he continued his
    undercover work against the Germans and their allies the Turks in Greenmantle (1916) and Mr Standfast (1919). The
    other two stories, The Three Hostages (1924) and The Island of Sheep (1936) were set in the postwar period, when
    Hannay's opponents were criminal gangs.</p>
