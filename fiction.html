    <hr class="divider">
    <br>
    With so many novels and works of fiction to choose from these days, where do you start? Here, we've put together
    reading lists compiled by some of the most eminent authors, poets, critics and academics writing today to help you
    find the best novels and works of fiction. We have book recommendations for everyone. Whether you're looking for
    some light holiday reading, science fiction, the best fiction books of 2022 or writing an essay about Charles
    Dickens books, you should be able to find what you're looking for.<br><br>

    Our fiction section is broadly organized as follows. First, we have interviews with leading academics on some of the
    great authors of the past (e.g Jane Austen, George Eliot, Vladimir Nabokov). Generally the recommendations will be a
    combination of the most important works by those authors, as well as one or two books of literary criticism.<br>

    For prominent authors still alive and writing today, our interviews tend to focus on the books that inspired them.
    Our collection of interviews and book recommendations entitled 'Novelists' Inspiration' can be found here.<br>

    We also have a lot of novels and fiction broken down geographically, so our site is a good place to find (say) the
    best Egyptian or South African novels or the best of Israeli fiction. The best Italian novels are a perennial
    favourite.<br>

    Finally, we also recommend the best genre books – from thrillers and horror to historical fiction , science fiction
    and romance.<br>

    The most recommended books include
    on the beach,father land etc.,

    <h4>categories</h4>
    <h5><a href="action.html">1.Action and Adventure</a></h5>
    <h6>Books in the action adventure genre not only have the action sequences seen in the action genre, but the
        plots continue into an adventure that takes the characters on a personal journey or to different
        geographical locations. A good example would be the James Bond series.<br>
        Action-adventure is a hybrid genre, and thus the definition is very inclusive, leading it to be perhaps the
        broadest genre of video games, and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow
        genres.</h6><br>
    <h5><a href="classic.html">2.classics</a></h5>
    <h6>A classic is a novel that represents a genre or a writing style, or it can be a novel that makes a contribution
        to literature. There are all kinds of classics, from horror classics to romance classics, from novels that sold
        millions of copies to a novel that changed how a genre was written.<br>
        Classic novels tend to deal with timeless, universal themes. Whether it's the eternal struggle of good vs. evil,
        the inevitability of death, or the corruptive nature of power, a classic novel should attempt to examine some
        enduring, immutable truth about the way humans behave.</h6><br>
