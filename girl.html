    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    The Diary of a Young Girl, also known as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language
    diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the
    Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration
    camp in 1945. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only
    known survivor, just after the Second World War was over. The diary has since been published in more than 70
    languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex:
    Diary Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread
    critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a
    Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity
    inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they
    adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the
    20th century.[1][2][3][4][5][6]<br><br>

    The copyright of the Dutch version of the diary, published in 1947, expired on 1 January 2016, seventy years after
    the author's death, as a result of a general rule in copyright law of the European Union. Following this, the
    original Dutch version was made available online.[7][8]<br><br>

    <h2>background</h2>
    During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne Frank received a blank diary as one of her presents on 12 June
    1942, her 13th birthday.[9][10] According to the Anne Frank House, the red, checkered autograph book which Anne used
    as her diary was actually not a surprise, since she had chosen it the day before with her father when browsing a
    bookstore near her home.[10] She entered a one-sentence note on her birthday, writing "I hope I will be able to
    confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of
    comfort and support."[11][12] The main diary was written from 14 June.[13][14]
<br><br>
    On 5 July 1942, Anne's older sister Margot received an official summons to report to a Nazi work camp in Germany,
    and on 6 July, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their parents Otto and Edith. They were later joined by Hermann
    van Pels, Otto's business partner, including his wife Auguste and their teenage son Peter.[15] Their hiding place
    was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex at the back of Otto's company building in Amsterdam.[15][16] Otto
    Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell pectin, a substance used
    to make jam. He stopped running his business while in hiding. But once he returned in the summer of 1945, he found
    his employees running it. The rooms that everyone hid in were concealed behind a movable bookcase in the same
    building as Opekta. The dentist of helper Miep Gies,[17] Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the
    published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert
    Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and
    one month.[18][19]
    <br><br>
    On 4 August 1944, they were discovered and deported to Nazi concentration camps. They were long thought to have been
    betrayed, although there are indications that their discovery may have been accidental, that the police raid had
    actually targeted "ration fraud".[20] Of the eight people, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne was 15 years old
    when she died in Bergen-Belsen. The exact date of her death is unknown, and has long been believed to be in late
    February or early March, a few weeks before the prisoners were liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945.[21]

    In the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white
    checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume
    (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original
    volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost – presumably after the arrest, when the hiding
    place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for
    preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1
    August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.[22]: 2

    The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and
    Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[23] but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the
    Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators
    worked.[24] The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by
    sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.[25]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
