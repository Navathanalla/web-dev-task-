    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    The Martian is a 2011 science fiction debut novel written by Andy Weir. The book was originally self-published on
    Weir's blog, in a serialized format.[1] In 2014, the book was re-released after Crown Publishing Group purchased the
    exclusive publishing rights. The story follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on
    Mars in 2035[2] and must improvise in order to survive.[3][4][5] A film adaptation, The Martian, directed by Ridley
    Scott and starring Matt Damon, was released in October 2015.[6]<br>

    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    In the year 2035,[7] the crew of NASA's Ares 3 mission have arrived at Acidalia Planitia for a planned month-long
    stay on Mars. After only six sols, an intense dust and wind storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle
    (MAV), which would trap them on the planet. During the hurried evacuation, an antenna tears loose and impales
    astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and engineer, also disabling his spacesuit radio. He is flung out of sight by the
    wind and presumed dead. As the MAV teeters dangerously, mission commander Melissa Lewis has no choice but to take
    off without completing the search for Watney.<br><br>

    However, Watney is not dead. His injury proves relatively minor, but with no long-range radio, he cannot communicate
    with anyone. He must rely on his own resourcefulness to survive. He begins a log of his experiences. His philosophy
    is to "work the problem", solving each challenge in turn as it confronts him. With food a critical, though not
    immediate, problem, he begins growing potatoes in the crew's Martian habitat (the Hab), and burns hydrazine to
    generate water for the plants.<br><br>

    NASA eventually discovers that Watney is alive when satellite images of the landing site show evidence of his
    activities; NASA personnel begin devising ways to rescue him, but withhold the news of his survival from the rest of
    the Ares 3 crew, on their way back to Earth aboard the Hermes spacecraft, so as not to distract them.<br><br>

    Watney plans to drive 3,235 km (2,010 mi) to Schiaparelli crater where the next mission, Ares 4, will land in four
    years and whose MAV is already pre-positioned. He begins modifying one of the rovers for the journey, adding solar
    cells and an additional battery. He makes a three-week test drive to recover the Pathfinder lander and Sojourner
    rover and brings them back to the Hab, enabling him to contact NASA. Mitch Henderson, the Ares 3 flight director,
    convinces NASA Administrator Teddy Sanders to allow him to inform the Ares 3 crew of Watney's survival; they are
    thrilled, except for Lewis, who is guilt-stricken at leaving him behind.<br><br>

    The canvas at one of the Hab airlocks tears because of Watney's repeated use of the same airlock, which was not
    designed for frequent and long-term usage. This results in the decompression of the Hab and nearly kills him. He
    repairs the Hab, but his plants are dead, threatening him again with eventual starvation. Setting aside safety
    protocols to comply with time constraints, NASA hastily prepares an uncrewed probe to send Watney supplies, but the
    rocket disintegrates after liftoff. A deal with the China National Space Administration provides a ready
    booster—planned for use with the Taiyang Shen, an uncrewed solar probe—to try again. With no time to build a probe
    with a soft-landing system, NASA is faced with the prospect of building a capsule whose cargo can survive crashing
    into the Martian surface at 300 meters per second (670 mph).<br><br>

    However, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a "slingshot" trajectory around Earth for a gravity assist[8] that
    could get Hermes back to Mars on a much-extended mission to save Watney, using the Chinese rocket booster to send a
    simpler resupply probe to Hermes as it passes Earth. Sanders vetoes the "Rich Purnell Maneuver", as it would entail
    risking the other crewmembers, but Henderson secretly emails the details to Hermes. All five of Watney's crewmates
    approve the plan. Once they begin the maneuver (having disabled the remote overrides), NASA has no choice but to
    support them. The resupply ship docks with Hermes successfully.
    <br><br>
    Watney resumes modifying the rover because the new rescue plan requires him to lift off from Mars in the Ares 4 MAV.
    While working on the rover, Watney accidentally shorts out the electronics of Pathfinder, losing the ability to
    communicate with Earth (except for spelling out Morse code with rocks for a one-way communication).
    <br><br>
    After Watney leaves for Schiaparelli, NASA discovers that a dust storm is approaching his path, but has no way to
    warn him. The rover's solar cells will be less and less able to recharge, endangering both the rendezvous and his
    immediate survival (if there is not enough power to run his life-support equipment). While crossing Arabia Terra,
    Watney becomes aware of the darkening sky and improvises a rough measurement of the storm's shape and direction of
    movement, enabling him to go around it.
    <br><br>
    Surviving a rover rollover on his descent into Schiaparelli, Watney reaches the MAV and reestablishes contact with
    NASA. He receives instructions on the radical modifications necessary to reduce the MAV's weight to enable it to
    intercept Hermes during its flyby. The modifications include removing the front of the MAV, which Watney has to
    cover with Hab canvas. After takeoff, the canvas tears, creating extra drag and leaving the MAV too low for the
    rendezvous. Lewis hastily improvises a plan to intercept the MAV by firing Hermes' attitude thrusters and then
    blowing a hole in the front airlock with an improvised sugar-and-liquid-oxygen bomb, using the thrust from the
    escaping air to reduce speed. Beck, the Hermes' EVA specialist, uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, MMU, on a tether to
    reach Watney and bring him back to Hermes. In a final log entry, Watney expresses his joy at being rescued,
    reflecting on the human instinct to help those in need.<br><br>
