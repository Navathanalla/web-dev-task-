  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <hr class="divider">
  To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly
  successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has
  become a classic of modern American literature, winning the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based
  on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville,
  Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.<br><br>

  Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor.
  Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for
  lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most
  widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional
  image of racial heroism."[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird
  involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of
  class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United
  States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has
  been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In
  2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one "every adult should read before they
  die".[3]<br><br>

  Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in
  education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To
  Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book "an astonishing phenomenon".[4] It was
  adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote.
  Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.<br><br>

  To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until Go Set a Watchman, an earlier draft of To Kill a
  Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February
  2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964<br><br>

  <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
  <hr class="divider">
  The story, told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933–35) of the Great
  Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. Nicknamed Scout, she lives with her
  older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. They also have a Black
  cook, Calpurnia, who had been with the family for many years and helped Atticus raise the two children.<br><br>

  Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are
  terrified, yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to
  talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors
  about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After
  two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the
  Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their
  disappointment, he never appears in person.<br><br>

  Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman,
  Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his
  ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a "nigger-lover". Scout is tempted to
  stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of
  men intent on lynching Tom. This crisis is averted in an unexpected manner: Scout, Jem, and Dill show up, and Scout
  inadvertently breaks the mob mentality by recognizing and talking to a classmate's father, and the would-be lynchers
  disperse.
  <br><br>
  Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but
  the Rev. Sykes, the pastor of Calpurnia's church, invites Jem, Scout, and Dill to watch from the colored balcony.
  Atticus establishes that Mayella and Bob Ewell are lying. It is revealed that Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom,
  subsequently resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as "white trash" who are
  not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful
  that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot 17 times and killed while trying to escape from prison.
  <br><br>
  Despite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he "destroyed
  [Ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial." Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break
  into the judge's house and menacing Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking
  home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the
  confusion, someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he
  is Boo Radley.
  <br><br>
  Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate
  is certain it was Boo. The sheriff decides that, to protect Boo's privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on
  his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he
  disappears, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's
  perspective.<br><br>
