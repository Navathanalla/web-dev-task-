    Across our site, we have many nonfiction book recommendations, divided by subject matter:

    Religion Books<br>
    Environmental Books<br>
    <br>
    Psychology Books<br>
    Art Books<br>
    Science Books<br>
    Technology Books<br>
    Business Books<br><br>

    Below, you'll find more general book recommendations, useful if you're in the mood for nonfiction, want to read
    a<br>
    really, really good book, but don't really mind so much what it's about.<br>
    <br>
    There are vast numbers of new books published every year, which makes choosing some of the best ones seem
    somewhat<br>
    random and subjective. To try and get some objective sense of which books to read, our first port of call every
    year<br>
    is always the Baillie Gifford Prize, the UK's most prestigious nonfiction prize. Judges scour hundreds of
    books—many<br>
    of them lengthy tomes.<br><br>

    Our aim is to find the best nonfiction books, books that are compelling, important and well-written.<br><br>

    Whether you're interested in neuroscience, the Holocaust or the Beatles, it's a great time to be alive if you
    like<br>
    reading really gripping nonfiction.<br>

    <h5><a href="memoir.html">1.Memoir</a></h5>
    <h6>
        A memoir (/ˈmɛm.wɑːr/;[1] from French mémoire [me.mwaʁ], from Latin memoria 'memory, remembrance') is any
        nonfiction narrative writing based in the author's personal memories.[2][3] The assertions made in the work are
        thus understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or
        autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A
        biography or autobiography tells the story "of a life", while a memoir often tells the story of a particular
        event or time, such as touchstone moments and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may
        be referred to as a memoirist or a memorialist.<br>
    </h6><br>
    
    <h5><a href="auto.html">2.Auto-Biography</a></h5>
    <h6>
        autobiography, the biography of oneself narrated by oneself. Autobiographical works can take many forms, from
        the intimate writings made during life that were not necessarily intended for publication (including letters,
        diaries, journals, memoirs, and reminiscences) to a formal book-length autobiography.
