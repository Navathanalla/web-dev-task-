    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    In 1982, Pope John Paul II privately issues a letter to the communist Polish government, stating that he will resign
    from the papacy and return to his hometown unless they cease their repression of counterrevolutionary movements in
    Poland, particularly the Solidarity trade union. Called the Warsaw Letter, it was later forwarded to Moscow,
    enraging Committee for State Security (KGB) director Yuri Andropov. He decides to plan for the pope’s assassination,
    which he believes would reinvigorate Communism in Eastern Europe, perceived by many to be in a state of decline.
    Known only by its designated number 15-8-82-666 for security reasons, the assassin is then selected as a Turk Muslim
    (understood to be Mehmet Ali Ağca), who would then be eliminated by Bulgarian KDS officer Boris Strokov afterwards
    for deniability. The operation was later unanimously approved by the Politburo.

    Meanwhile, Oleg Zaitzev, a communications officer in the KGB tasked with sending and receiving encrypted dispatches
    to and from KGB stations across Europe, pieces together the plot to kill the pope, and becomes deeply troubled with
    the prospect of murdering an innocent person for political purposes. He later decides to make contact with the local
    CIA station chief Edward Foley as well as his wife and agent Mary Pat, intending to defect and then be extracted out
    of the Soviet Union with his family, in exchange for providing information on the assassination plot as well as the
    names of KGB deep-penetration agents in the American and British governments.

    The Foleys instruct Zaitzev to bring his family to Budapest, Hungary under the guise of taking a vacation. They are
    then to be assisted by British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) officers stationed in the city, because the CIA
    station there was compromised; as a result, Jack Ryan, former Marine and the CIA liaison to SIS back in London, was
    sent there to represent the agency. One early morning, the Zaitzevs were spirited out of the hotel they were
    staying. Accompanied by Ryan, they are then smuggled to Yugoslavia, where they immediately fly to the United
    Kingdom. By then, SIS agents had planted dead bodies that are physically identical to the family into their hotel
    room, which was then set on fire, thus deceiving the KGB.

    After settling down in a safehouse outside Manchester, Zaitzev reveals what he knows about the assassination plot,
    which alarms the SIS and the CIA. Ryan was later sent to St. Peter's Square in Vatican City to accompany the British
    SIS officers on the ground to ascertain how the hit on the pope will play out, as well as to try capturing the
    shooter. At the pope's weekly audience, Ryan manages to capture Strokov; however, the Pope gets shot anyway by the
    real shooter Ağca. Nevertheless, the pontiff recovers from his wounds. It was then revealed that Strokov was
    executed by the British as retaliation for murdering Soviet defector Georgi Markov on British soil four years ago.
