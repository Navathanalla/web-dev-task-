    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery thriller novel by Dan Brown. It is Brown's second novel to include the character
    Robert Langdon: the first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons. The Da Vinci Code follows "symbologist" Robert Langdon
    and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris causes them to become involved in a
    battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene having had a
    child together.<br><br>

    The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the Merovingian kings of
    France were descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's The
    Templar Revelation (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail
    (1982) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material.<br><br>

    The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary Magdalene's
    role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many Christian
    denominations as an attack on the Catholic Church, and consistently criticized for its historical and scientific
    inaccuracies. The novel nonetheless became a massive worldwide bestseller[1] that sold 80 million copies as of
    2009[2] and has been translated into 44 languages. In November 2004, Random House published a Special Illustrated
    Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a film adaptation was released by Columbia Pictures.<br><br>

    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    <hr class="divider">
    Louvre curator and Priory of Sion grand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino
    Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover
    the location of the "keystone," an item crucial in the search for the Holy Grail.<br><br>

    After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard
    professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to
    help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes
    a Fibonacci sequence out of order and an anagram 'O, draconian devil Oh, lame saint'.<br><br>

    Langdon explains to Fache that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to
    the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.<br><br>

    Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter,
    and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant
    for Neveu, said "P.S. Find Robert Langdon," which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival. However, "P.S." does
    not refer to "postscript", but rather to Sophie — the nickname given to her by her grandfather was "Princess
    Sophie". However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads to
    Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, which in turn leads to his painting Madonna of the Rocks. They find a pendant which
    holds the address of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich.<br><br>

    Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find a box containing the
    keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When
    these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar
    breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex
    contains clues to its password.<br><br>

    Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail,
    the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but
    connected to Mary Magdalene, and that she was Jesus Christ's wife and is the person to his right in The Last
    Supper.<br><br>

    The trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of
    letters spell out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along
    with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.<br><br>

    During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier:
    arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnessed a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret
    basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she was shocked to see her grandfather with a
    woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who were wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess.
    She fled the house and broke off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient
    ceremony known as hieros gamos or "sacred marriage."<br><br>

    By the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working.
    Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ
    married Mary Magdalene and fathered children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve
    the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is "apple." Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its
    contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air.<br><br>

    Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious
    sect Opus Dei and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the
    police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him
    and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas
    was found dead later from a gunshot wound.<br><br>

    The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be
    Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The
    guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu
    and her brother are descendants of Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible
    threats to her life.<br><br>

    The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below the La
    Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the "Rose Line," an allusion to
    "Rosslyn." Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line (prime meridian) to La
    Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights
    did before her.<br><br>
