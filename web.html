  Do you have a favorite type of book, either fiction or nonfiction? Are you thinking about branching out and enjoying a
  new genre? If so, a list of book types or genres can help you choose what to read next. See if any of the below
  subtypes catch your eye.<br>
  <hr class="divider">
  <h2>FICTION :</h2>
  <hr class="divider">
  Fiction books contain a story that the author made up, such as romance or children's books. The most commonly read
  works are works of fiction. Perhaps some of their elements are based on hints of truth, but they have been elaborated,
  fabricated, and used to embellish into a new story.
  <br><br>
  Some examples of classic fiction books are :
  <br>
  The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway<br>
  To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee<br>
  Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston<br>
  <hr class="divider">
  <h2>NON-FICTION :</h2>
  <hr class="divider">
  Nonfiction books contain factual information, such as biographies and history books.<br><br>

  Examples of nonfiction books include:<br>

  Most biographies are nonfiction. We say "most" biographies, because a biography of a fictional character is really a
  fictional book.<br>
  The Diary of Anne Frank is nonfiction and a journal, making it a nonfiction journal.<br>
  Most Dictionaries and encyclopedias are nonfiction because they contain facts about words.<br>
  Travel books such as an atlas are nonfiction.<br>
  “How to” books that teach real skills, like the classic Betty Crocker Cookbook are considered factual.<br>

    <h2> Current Reading Selection, 10 March 2022 to 20 May 2022: The Henna Artist, by Alka Joshi</h2>

      Escaping from an abusive marriage, seventeen-year-old Lakshmi makes her way alone to the vibrant 1950s pink
      city<br>
      of
      Jaipur. There she becomes the most highly requested henna artist—and confidante—to the wealthy women of the
      upper<br>
      class. But trusted with the secrets of the rich, she can never reveal her own…<br>
      Known for her original designs and sage advice, Lakshmi must tread carefully to avoid the jealous gossips who
      could<br>
      ruin her reputation and her livelihood. As she pursues her dream of independent life, Lakshmi is startled when she
      is<br>
      confronted by her husband. The latter has tracked her down these many years later with a high-spirited young girl
      in<br>
      tow—a sister Lakshmi never knew of. Suddenly the caution that she has carefully cultivated as protection is<br>
      threatened. Still, she perseveres, applying her talents and lifting up those that surround her as she does.<br>
      Reading The Henna Artist is like travelling in a car that is going at just the right speed. At times, author
      Alka<br>
      Joshi stops to point out sights and scenes on the way. At other times, she revs up the story and you find
      yourself<br>
      on a thrilling ride to an unknown destination. And that is the best part. Just when you think you know where
      you<br>
      are headed, Joshi takes a turn that leaves you completely in the lurch.<br>

    <h2>HOW IT WORKS??</h2>
    We have created Inspiring Reads covering lifelong
    learning, personal growth, novels and other books selected by our members. Books will include those written by<br>
    Trinity alumni, as well as Irish and International authors and will be selected by Inspiring Reads members. The<br>
    Inspiring Reads book club will connect through a private forum where all participants can discuss the current
    book<br>
    and network with each other. Joining is completely free; you just have to get a copy of the book to enjoy. The<br>
    Inspiring Reads book club will read one book every two months so that you will have plenty of time for each
    book.<br>
    <h2>Explore different book types</h2>
